# Applies unapplied migrations to a live database, and records what it applied.
#
# The loop this replaces started at V001 every time. Against a database that already has a schema
# that always fails on the first file, because V001 creates enums and PostgreSQL has no
# CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS -- so the migrations after it were never reached. On 2026-08-21 the
# review deployment was found holding V001-V011 and V013, with V012 and V014 silently absent, and
# a merged feature depending on V012 that would have failed on a column that did not exist.
#
# Nothing recorded the gap because nothing recorded anything. This writes a ledger so that the
# question "which migrations has this database had" has an answer.
#
# schema_migration_log is deployment bookkeeping, not application schema, which is why it is
# created here rather than by a migration: infra/migrations/README.md keeps operational data out of
# migrations, and a ledger that needed a migration to exist could not record the migration that
# created it.
