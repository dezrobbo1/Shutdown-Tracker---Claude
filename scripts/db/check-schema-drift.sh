# Fails if a live database is behind the migration set. Read-only; safe to run anywhere.
#
# Two checks, because either alone can be fooled:
#
#   1. The ledger against the directory listing. Answers "has every migration been applied".
#   2. The tables the migrations create against the tables the database has. Answers "does the
#      schema actually look right", and does not trust the ledger to say so.
#
# Both expectations are derived, never transcribed. A hand-maintained list rots exactly the way
# validate-migrations.sh's EXPECTED_TABLES did: it named 33 tables when the migrations created 35,
# so it passed against a database missing the two most recent ones. Keeping such a list current is
# the same discipline that failed in the first place.
